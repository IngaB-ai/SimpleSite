# SimpleSite NFLCrime


### Top Crimes(main) page:
- make components for Top crime, Top players, Top teams
- make services for them 
- get crimes from the endpoint in json formate
- list crimes in decreasing order in a table formate
- use basic css ui (I used Boostrap for this example)
- has an option to click on a crime and gsee the top players in the separate page more detail 

*screenshots will be added 


### Top Players of crimes page:
- get details of selected crime from an endpoint
- displays them in a tab

*screenshots will be added 

### Future features:
- proceed with the same maner with other top rankings. Now when there is template should 1/10 of a time
- rearange code and make it pre-production ready
- find a reason why charts.js is not working properly. Thorougly checked  and changed the DI. It is not an issue.
- tweak component tree to more eye pleasing 
- write tests


### Technicalities
- It should be e built using Angular (NOT angular.js)
- The endpoint for retrieving the list of shirts is at NflArrest.com/api/v1/crime
- You may use any additional libraries
- Unit tests
